# Simple TODO App

Classic beginner ReactJS & Redux project. I'm not original here)

Basic logic is provided, like add, delete, validate tasks. Also you can mark task as 'completed'. 

All changes are handled with React hooks and Redux store. That`s just basic logic component without any UI or any addons. For comfort I used MaterialUI ready components.

## Usage

Given that the project has not been published, you can run the last one on your localhost and try it.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
